After all that we’ve been through  
_I know that I will always **love you**_  
> From now until forever baby... I can’t imagine anything better

- [ ] After 
- [ ] all that
- [ ] we’ve been
- [x] through!

```
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
```

There is nothing we can’t do  

_I see you along the way baby..._
