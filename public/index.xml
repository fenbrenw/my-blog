      <description>Warren Buffett once said that as an investor, it is wise to be “Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
In a up trend on any timescale, a smart trader would “buy the dip” – buy any time there’s a sizeable selloff. Let’s define an “up trend” in the broadest sense: if price is making higher all time highs, it’s in an uptrend. So any time a new all time high is achieved, and price starts to slide, does buying into the selloff and fear produce positive returns?</description>

      <title>EMA x SMA Algorithm &amp; Backtest</title>

      <description>This algorithm is based on the “moving average crossover” strategy. Traditionally, this strategy involves taking two moving averages – a “slow” one that averages over a longer time window and a “fast” one that averages over a shorter time window – and buy/sell based on when the two moving averages crossover.
I used a 50-day simple moving average (SMA) as the “slow” one and 10, 20, 30, and 40-day exponential moving averages (EMA) as the fast ones.</description>
